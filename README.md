Analysis of automotive vehicles and segment 
1. Background & Motivation
This is overall descriptive analysis of the vehicle date for the period of April 2021. The overall approach is to find patterns, drill into details and as whole understanding the data.

Some relevant assumptions has been made to generalize the data and effectively arrive on conclusions, this may lead to over generalisation of some paramters leading to generic analysis in some data points.

Analysis is done in 2 parts.
Python is used for EDA and data cleaning. Than a source file is generated at the end to be linked in tableau.
Tableau has been used as visuaization tool and images are exported back in this juypter notebook.
